# Mentors Training Workshop
## Introduction
- One of the main learning paths in the **CS Internship** program is the **Business Skills Learning Path**, also known as **Soft Skills Learning Path**.
- The goal of the **Business Skills Learning Path** is to acquire a set of skills alongside technical expertise, which can transform any workforce into an **impactful and influential presence in the business environment**. By developing these soft skills, individuals can become influential contributors within the business space, complementing their technical abilities with effective communication, problem-solving, leadership, and other valuable competencies.
- Workshops for mentorship are typically organized by professionals who have expertise in the workshop's subject area. These workshops are initially conducted with the participation of individuals who meet the eligibility criteria at the time of workshop formation.
- These skill in this program is achieved through organizing a series of workshops, each designed with a specific goal to acquire soft skills. These workshops are tailored to help participants develop and enhance their soft skills effectively.
- The sessions of the first series are recorded and made available to individuals who join this path later. If you are reading this page, it means you are going to watch the workshop videos.

## What prerequisits you should have?
In each step's file, there is a section called **"Mentorship Path Training"**. This section contains links to at least one video. You should follow the instructions below and watch each of the videos when you reach the corresponding step. 

- First of all, please check your access to the videos. If you don't have access, inform your mentoring intern. Before proceeding, ensure that you have access to the specified videos.
- Secondly, ask your mentoring intern to add you to the **CS Internship - Mentoring Workshops** group in MS Teams. Set a session with you mentoring intern to make sure that you have access to this group. 
- Thirdly, you have to ask your mentoring intern to send you the report template to wirte your reports about the videos.
  
## How to watch videos? 
- In the mentoring training path, you should watch the videos provided in your step's file. What you should do in this part could simply abbreviated into four main sequentially tasks: **Watch**, **Think**, **Write** and **Talk**
  1. **Watch** the specified video. Watch it deeply! Make sure you have settled a proper environment and situation to watch it. In this way, you can have the highest of your focus on it.
  2. **Think** about the discussed concepts in this video in your daily attitudes. Your task is to observe and find the concepts you heard in the video in your daily life. 
  3. **Write** a report about what you understood from this video. In this report you should:
	  - write your understandings of the proposed concepts in the video.
	  - write your answers to the questions asked in the video.
	  - write at least three paragraphs about your related experience and observations to the concepts in the video.
  4. Finally, send your report to your mentoring intern to set a meeting for the next sprint. In this meeting, try to **Talk** about your observations you had during the current sprint.

## How to participate in the mentors training workshops?
- After you have watched each video, then you should write your report about it, and send it to your mentoring intern.
- You should ask your mentoring intern to set a workshop reservation for each video's report. You will attend each mentorship workshop only for one report.
- Since you have already gained access to the desired workshop group, you must be present at the specified time and day for the session as scheduled.

## Is it possible for an intern to participate with two reports in a single workshop, if desired?
### Yes. To participate with two reports related to consecutive videos in a single workshop, follow these steps for easier understanding:

1. Begin by watching the first video.
2. Send the report of the first video to your mentoring intern.
3. Request your mentoring intern to schedule a mentorship session for your report.
4. Request your mentoring intern to forward the report of the first video for evaluation by an available mentor.
   - Note: Your mentoring intern will help in transferring your request to a mentor based on their availability.
5. The mentoring intern informs the intern of the mentor's assessment of the report.

### The outcome of this evaluation will fall into one of two scenarios:

#### A - If the mentor thinks the first report is good enough:

1. You (the intern) can watch the second video after at least 7 days from viewing the first video.
  After watching the second video, you can prepare the report for the second video and send it to your mentoring intern.
2. Request your mentoring intern to schedule a session for both your reports.
   - Note: Keep in mind that if you write the report in the current sprint, the session can be scheduled for the next sprint or later.

####  B -  If the mentor believes the first report does not meet the desired quality standards:
- You will participate in the pre-scheduled session with the same first report and won't be able to use this opportunity.

### **Important Note:** Please keep in mind that mentor availability to review your reports is not guaranteed. Furthermore, the deadline for reviewing your reports may be set in a way that it doesn't affect the scheduling of mentorship sessions to be held sooner.
